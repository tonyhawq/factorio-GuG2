[technology-description]
separation=Separate solids and liquids.
geothermal-power=Extract heat from the tectonic plates of the nauvis. Expect to get ~2x the efficiency of tube boilers, or more if you use desalination plants.
oil-refining=Refine heavy hydrocarbons down into lighter, more useful forms.
mechanical-science=Research into new ways of utilizing mechanical principles.
electromagnetic-science=Research into the new domain of electricity and how to best utilize it.
optics=Requirement of having lamps is not heavily enforced as they are generally the most useless fixtures. However, distributing high amount of them all over the factory no longer looks like such a pointless exercise, after the night stoped appearing so ridiculously inconsequantial.
polymers=Long chains of hydrocarbons.
urea=Valuable nitrogenous product.
incinerating=Destroy waste products with high heat.
zinc-processing=Process zinc ores into zinc products.
syngas=Refine tar into gaseous fuel.
alloying=Combine metals to form alloys with desireable properties.
mechanics=Springs, gears and other things!
smelting=Refine raw ores into their finished products for wonderous results!
coal-processing=Process raw coal into more refined forms to extract energy.
wood-processing=Grow organic and asbestos free wood.
tar-processing=Refine raw hydrocarbons into industrially significant products.
basic-chemistry=IGBLON reference?
aluminum-processing=Main component of both soda cans and spaceships.
blasting=Process high-temperature alloys and metals.
organics=Oozing and creeping and industrially annoying.
microbiology=Oozing and creeping, on the micro-scale.
crushing=Crush large particles into fines.
masonry=Bricks, but fancy.
glassworking=Work silica into beautiful and transparent forms.
electromagnetism=Harness the power of electrons.
